## Learning Path

### Basic Track
The basic track establishes a solid foundation in Python programming, covering:

1. **Python Fundamentals**
   - Core language syntax and concepts
   - Variables and data types
   - Control flow and functions
   - Error handling mechanisms
   - Module system and package management

2. **Data Structures**
   - Built-in data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
   - List and dictionary comprehensions
   - Collections module and its utilities
   - Efficient data structure usage patterns

3. **Object-Oriented Programming Basics**
   - Classes and objects
   - Inheritance and composition
   - Encapsulation principles
   - Polymorphism implementation

4. **File Handling**
   - File operations and management
   - JSON and CSV processing
   - Logging and error tracking
   - File system operations

### Advanced Track
The advanced track focuses on professional development skills and cloud engineering concepts:

1. **Advanced Python Concepts**
   - Decorators and metaprogramming
   - Generators and iterators
   - Context managers
   - Asynchronous programming
   - Advanced OOP concepts

2. **Backend Development**
   - Web frameworks (Django/Flask)
   - RESTful API development
   - Database integration
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Testing methodologies

3. **Cloud Engineering**
   - AWS service integration with boto3
   - Container orchestration
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
   - Serverless architecture
   - Monitoring and logging in cloud environments

4. **Professional Practices**
